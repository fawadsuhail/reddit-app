#  Sample Reddit app

A simple reddit app that fetches data from the reddit API and displays it in a UITableView. The purpose is to showcase the app architecture. The main architecture I used is VIPER.

###### Third party dependencies

I used `Promises` and `SDWebImage`
Promises help me structure the code better and avoid nested blocks
SDWebImage is used for image caching.
